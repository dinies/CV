\section{Career Motivation}
I find profound fulfillment in working as a SLAM software engineer,
as it provides the types of challenges I enjoy solving most.
I strongly value collaboration and believe that working effectively
within a team is paramount. Driven by curiosity, I am eager to
deeply understand how systems work. I have a strong passion for
programming and prefer using statically typed languages.
I bring seven years of professional experience with \textbf{C++} and
have been learning \textbf{Rust} for the past year.

Completed a Master’s degree in Robotics with a strong focus on SLAM
and autonomous systems. Built expertise in kinematics, dynamics,
navigation, filtering, and AI (planning and reasoning).
Worked on multiple hands-on robotics projects, applying theoretical
concepts to real-world challenges. For my thesis, developed a 3D
LiDAR SLAM pipeline in C++ and ROS, using a probabilistic
least-squares approach to extract high-level geometric features.\\

\jobentry {OCT 2020,APR 2022}{Full Time}
{INRIA, French national research institute}{Robotics Software Engineer} {
	Developed a system from scratch to teleoperate an industrial
	robot in hazardous environments. Implemented each pipeline
	module in \textbf{C++}, containerized with \textbf{Docker},
	and integrated using \textbf{ROS}. Simulated system dynamics
	in a \textbf{digital twin} using \textbf{DART} and
	\textbf{Gazebo}. Applied advanced control techniques with
	\textbf{Pinocchio} and \textbf{TSID} libraries to control
	the robot in both \textbf{Cartesian} and \textbf{joint space}.
