Dear Madam or Sir,
\medskip

I am a senior software engineer with 5+ years of experience, based in Bristol.
I am applying to the Software Engineer II role since the job description and Sony's mission resonated with my professional experience and values:
\begin{itemize}
\item
I have experience creating command-line utilities, graphical user interfaces, and in general, automated tools to improve the productivity of the team.
\item
I strive to deliver the cleanest software architectural design.
\item
I always push for the adoption of the latest stable C++ standard.
\item
I consider developing unit testing as important as the implementation of the core logic. 
\item
I thrive when the team is applying 'SAFe' protocols. Also because I enjoy creating clear designs of the planned work. 
\end{itemize}
\medskip

Yours faithfully,
\medskip

Edoardo
