Dear Hiring Manager,\\
\vspace{0.4cm}
The Robotics Software Engineer - Smart Perception Engineer m/f  opening, with a base in Toulouse,
 which I saw advertised on \textbf{Linkedin}, is of great interest to me.\\\smallskip
Having an ardent interest in Space Robotics,
 I have felt compelled to search for a job opportunity at Airbus.
It was very exciting for me to hear that the company aims to
 \textit{"acquire new talent and skills while also ramping up production volume"}.
