The \textbf{ Neuro-robotics Research Engineer } opening is of great interest to me. I have found it on the \textbf{robotics worldwide} notice board.\\
Topics as neuroscience and human cognition are of great interest to me: I would love to see the air of mystery around \textbf{human consciousness} fall apart in the near future.\\
It is my opinion and belief that the fastest way to achieve super-human artificial intelligence would be through a better understanding of \textbf{it}.\\
Additionally, during my academic studies, I developed a strong passion for \textbf{Robotics} and \textbf{Software development}.\\
Being able to define rules of a system through a programming language and seeing it as it evolves has been a very fulfilling experience.\\
Honestly, I search for a working opportunity that would allow expressing my creativity.\\
On several occasions, I was required to build simulated \textbf{dynamic systems} for academic projects.
