The \textbf{ Neuro-robotics Research Engineer } opening is of great interest to me. I have found it on the \textbf{robotics worldwide} notice board.\\
\\
Topics as neuroscience and human cognition are of great interest to me: I would love to see the air of mystery around \textbf{human consciousness} fall apart in the near future.\\
It is my opinion and belief that the fastest way to achieve super-human artificial intelligence would be through a better understanding of \textbf{it}.\\
Additionally, during my academic studies, I developed a strong passion for \textbf{Robotics} and \textbf{Software development}.\\
Being able to define rules of a system through a programming language and seeing it as it evolves has been a very fulfilling experience.\\
\\
Honestly, I search for a working opportunity that would allow expressing my creativity.\\
\\
On several occasions, I was required to build simulated \textbf{dynamic systems} for academic projects.\\
The most interesting projects to mention for this opening are:\\
\\
- A convolutional neural-network built with Spiking Neurons that resembles the behaviour of real neurons inside the biological brain.\\
This project was developed in python using Tensorflow API at a very low-level.\\
\href{https://github.com/dinies/SpikingCNN}{\textbf{SpikingCNN-Repository}}\\
\\
- My Master Degree Thesis:  A mobile robotics SLAM system for autonomous navigation which performs 3D LIDAR Odometry and Tracking.\\
The entire project was developed in C++ using ROS and CMake and it had to address the compatibility with the robotics utility framework developed by the academic department.\\
\href{https://github.com/dinies/3D-Lidar-Odometry-and-Tracking}{\textbf{LidarOdometry-Repository}}\\
\\
- A reinforcement learning experiment in which the autonomous agent is trained to play chess endgame scenarios improving its winning percentage.\\
Developed entirely in python, using MySQL as database.\\
\href{https://github.com/dinies/ArtificialIntelligence/tree/master/RLproject}{\textbf{RL-Chess-Repository}}\\
\\
- A game in first person, when the player explores a 3D environment created using WebGL and advanced computer graphics, the project has been developed entirely in Javascript.\\
\href{https://github.com/dinies/InteractiveGraphics/tree/master/final-project/slander}{\textbf{SlenderMan-Repository}}\\
\\
I consider problem-solving and programming as two of my most developed skills.\\
In each of my projects, I prefer to work in UNIX environments, with C++ as preferred programming language.\\
\\
I have been using \textit{Agile} principles since my first internship.\\
It is my belief that testing my code is extremely important, hence wherever it is manageable I apply \textbf{TDD} practices.\\
\\
I am enthralled by the possibility to work on the \textbf{Neurorobotics platform}.\\
\\


Thank you for considering me for this opening.\\
\\
Best regards,\\
\\
Edoardo Ghini
