Ciao Tom!
How are you doing?
I am writing to ask a favour.
I am being made redundant at Kudan, so I am searching for the next job.
I was looking at some of Sony's available roles. Could you point me toward someone at Sony that you know?
Do you think I should apply directly through the website?
The role I would like to apply for is called: Senior Software Engineer in Test
Thanks for any help you can give!
Edo
