Dear Madam or Sir,
\medskip

I am a Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience, based in Bristol.
I am applying to the Senior Software Engineer role since the job description and the company mission resonated with my professional experience and values:
\begin{itemize}
\item
I believe in clean software architectural design.
\item
I have been following object oriented design principles throughout my career.
\item
I understand the value that Test Driven Development brings to the table: unparalleled bug prevention translating in better code safety.
\item
Passionate about containerisation with Docker.
\item
Worked in codebases where Jenkins was used for CI/CD pipelines.
\end{itemize}
\medskip

I have had exposure to Java at the beginning of my career and after that I worked with C++ and python.
The statement of Lloyds Banking Group excites me together with the company culture: "finance as force for good".
\bigskip

Yours faithfully,
\medskip

Edoardo
