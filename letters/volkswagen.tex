Dear Dr. Parasos,\\

Having an ardent interest for Robotics, I have felt compelled to search a job opportunity in Volkswagen.
It was very exciting for me to hear that the company aims to solve fully autonomous driving by the second half of the decade.
Honestly, knowing that I contributed to it when this will occur, would assuredly bring me a great sense of fullfillment.
Usually, when I am working on a project that interests me I become extremely passionate and channel a lot of energy into it.
I have studied your recent publications, and I find  extremely interesting the one which controls the robot using ProMPs without knowing the dynamic properties.
If I had to choose, I would say that my two greatest interests are Programming and Robotics Control, actually I believe the former to be a form of art.
Being able to model the evolution of dynamic system through programming has been a very fulfilling experience.
Among personal projects that are more affine to the company goals, I would like to mention:
\begin{itemize}
\item My Master Degree Thesis:  A mobile robotics SLAM system for autonomous navigation which performs 3D LIDAR Odometry and Tracking.
The entire project was developed in C++ using ROS.\\
\href{https://github.com/dinies/3D-Lidar-Odometry-and-Tracking}{\textbf{LidarOdometry-Repository}}\\
\item My working period at INRIA
\end{itemize}
I am seeking a working opportunity that would allow expressing my creativity.
Thus, I think that Volswagen will be one of the best companies to work for.


Salutations ......................
