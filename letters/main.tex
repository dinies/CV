Usually, when I am working on a project that interests me
 I become extremely passionate and channel a lot of energy into it.
If I had to choose, I would say that my two greatest interests are
 Programming and Robotics Control, actually I believe the former to be a form of art.\\\smallskip
Moreover, since the first academy projects, I have enjoyed greatly
  being able to model the evolution of dynamic systems through programming.
  The topic of my master thesis was \textbf{SLAM}.
  \footnote{ \textit{Position tracking in 3D scenes using high order primitives.}
  \quad links to \href{https://github.com/dinies/3D-Lidar-Odometry-and-Tracking}{code} and 
  \href{https://github.com/dinies/MasterThesis-ArtificialIntelligence-Robotics/blob/master/MaterThesis_Edoardo_Ghini.pdf}
  {thesis}.}
I developed a system for autonomous navigation which performs
 3D LIDAR Odometry and Tracking on high order features extracted from the point cloud.\\\smallskip
After that I have maturated even more interest in \textbf{autonomous navigation }
 even if my job after graduation focused on something else entirely:
 I was employed in INRIA as a robotics engineer where I developed  a system for teleoperation.
During this experience I learned a lot because I was responsible
 for the design and implementation of the entire pipeline software-side:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  dynamic simulation and control starting from URDF description of robots.
  \item  GUI prototyping using an open-source C++ library.
  \item  containerization and automation of the development environment.
  \item  handling communication between modules with ROS.
\end{itemize}
In both these experiences, I have built a strong C++ foundation.\\\smallskip
Finally, I want to mention an individual academic project that I completed during my masters:
  A \textbf{convolutional neural-net} built with \textbf{Spiking Neurons} in Python
  using \textbf{Tensorflow}, that resembles the behavior of real neurons inside the biological brain.\\
I am seeking a working opportunity that would allow expressing my creativity.
Thus, I would greatly appreciate your review of my resume and outlined credentials.
I believe that I can be a valuable addition to the \company\ team.\\\smallskip
At your convenience, I am available for further discussion. I look forward to your response.\\\bigskip
Sincerely,\\
Edoardo Ghini
